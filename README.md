## Free Stuff

This is an app where someone that has something that someone else might need or like it, but the owner doesn't want to sell it, they can just post it on the website and someone may actually like it or need.

The main idea behind this, is that there are many people that in their house might have many things that they don't need anymore, and they would like to give it someone. There are also many people needed everywhere, they don't have the money to buy some of the things that they need.

The same way people will have only one place that can go online and make sure that everything that they see there is for free.

Keep in mind that all the items in this site are for free for the user.

## How to use the app

* When you access to the site you can see all the posts.
* You can also see posts separated by diferent categories.
* When you click a post you will see all the information related to that post.
* If you wish to post an item, you must register or log in.
* If you wish to leave a comment, you must log in or register.
